               History: <span>
                  Most of the C&amp;SLR's route had been constructed with tunnels 10 feet 2 inches (3.10 m) or 10 feet 6 inches (3.20 m) in diameter,
                  smaller than the 11 feet 6 inches (3.51 m) diameter that had been adopted as the standard for the CCE&amp;HR and other deep level
                  tube lines. The smaller tunnel size restricted the capacity of the C&amp;SLR's trains and, in 1912, the C&amp;SLR published a bill
                  for their enlargement. A separate bill was published at the same time by the London Electric Railway (LER), that included
                  plans to construct tunnels to connect the C&amp;SLR at Euston to the CCE&amp;HR's station at Camden Town. Together, the works proposed
                  in these bills would enable trains of each company to run over the route of the other, effectively combining the two separate
                  railways. The reconstruction and extension works were postponed during World War I and did not begin until 1922. The C&amp;SLR
                  platforms and the tunnels between Euston and Moorgate were closed for the reconstruction on 8 August 1922. They reopened on
                  20 April 1924 along with the new link to Camden Town.

               History: <span>
                                  The station was opened on 1 September 1892 as part of the Metropolitan Railway (Met) extension from Chalfont
                  Road (now Chalfont &amp; Latimer) to Aylesbury. On 12 March 1922, its name was changed to "Amersham &amp; Chesham Bois", but the original
                  name was restored during 1937.
                                  
                                  From 16 March 1899, the Great Central Railway served the station through its extension to Marylebone. Consequently,
                  the station became joint Met/GCR owned. On 1 January 1923, the GCR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER)
                  as part of the Railways Act 1921, and on 1 July 1933, the Met became part of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB),
                  thus becoming the Metropolitan line of the London Underground. On 1 January 1948, the LNER was nationalised, its share of
                  the station initially coming under the control of the Eastern Region of British Railways, before being transferred to the
                  London Midland Region in 1958.
                                  
                                  On 12 September 1960, the tracks from Rickmansworth to Amersham were electrified, partially fulfilling plans
                  first proposed some thirty years earlier. The rolling stock ordered by London Underground as part of this project, the A60
                  stock, is named after Amersham.

               History: <span> 
                                  In the first half of the 19th century, the population and physical extent of London grew greatly. The congested
                  streets and the distance to the City from the stations to the north and west prompted many attempts to get parliamentary approval
                  to build new railway lines into the City. In 1852, Charles Pearson planned a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross. Although
                  the plan was supported by the City, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed. The Bayswater,
                  Paddington, and Holborn Bridge Railway Company was established to connect the Great Western Railway's (GWR) Paddington station
                  to Pearson's route at King's Cross. A bill was published in November 1852 and in January 1853 the directors held their first
                  meeting and appointed John Fowler as its engineer. Several bills were submitted for a route between Paddington and Farringdon.The
                  company's name was also to be changed again, to Metropolitan Railway and the route was approved on 7 August 1854.

                                  Cassiobridge is a proposed London Underground station in Watford, Hertfordshire, England. The station would
                  be part of the Croxley Rail Link project, a scheme to extend the Metropolitan line to Watford Junction railway station. It
                  would be served by Metropolitan line trains between Watford Junction and Central London via Baker Street. The railway line
                  would run over Ascot Road via a viaduct and the platforms will be situated on the east side of the road. Entrance to the station
                  would be from the west side of the road, with a ticket hall and other facilities at street level. Passengers would gain access
                  to the platforms via stairs and lifts and a short footbridge over the road.
                                  
                                  The station is projected to offer interchange with local transport services, and operate as an unstaffed station,
                  providing automatic ticketing facilities similar to a DLR station. There is potential for Park and Ride facilities to be provided,
                  although planning documents indicate high levels of congestion on adjacent roads.

                  line extension to Battersea. The station is projected to open along with the rest of the extension in 2020, and will serve
                  the rapidly growing Nine Elms area, New Covent Garden Market and the new Embassy of the United States.
                                  
                                  The new station is close to the site of the former Nine Elms railway station, once the terminus of the London
                  and South Western Railway.

               History: <span>
                                  The first Underground Line at Waterloo was opened on 8 August 1898 by the Waterloo &amp; City Railway (W&amp;CR),
                  a subsidiary of the owners of the main line station, the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR). The W&amp;CR, nicknamed "The
                  Drain", achieved in a limited way the L&amp;SWR's original plan of taking its tracks the short distance north-east into the City
                  of London.
                                  
                                  On 10 March 1906, the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR, now the Bakerloo line) was opened. On 13 September
                  1926, the extension of the Hampstead &amp; Highgate line (as the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line was then known) was
                  opened from Embankment to the existing City &amp; South London Railway station Kennington with a new station at Waterloo.
                                  
                                  As a subsidiary of the L&amp;SWR and its successor, the Southern Railway, the W&amp;CR was not a part of the London
                  Underground system. Following nationalisation of the main line railway companies in 1948, it became part of British Railways
                  (later British Rail).

               History: <span>
                                  The station opened on 19 September 1932 when the first section of the Cockfosters extension from Finsbury
                  Park was opened.
                                  
                                  Like all stations on the extension, Wood Green set new aesthetic standards, not previously seen on London's
                  Underground. When the Cockfosters extension was planned, alternative names for this station&#8212;"Lordship Lane" and "Wood Green
                  Central"&#8212;were considered, but rejected. Architecturally, this station, designed by Charles Holden, is a well-preserved example
                  of the modernist house style Holden developed for London Transport in the 1930s. Located on a corner site, the main frontage
                  is curved and is flanked by two ventilation towers, although these are later additions to the station. On the northern side,
                  the structure also incorporates a shop which forms part of the parade in High Road. The other end of the parade features a
                  large London Underground sub-station.
                                  
                                  Since July 2011, the station has been a grade II listed building, which now means every station building between
                  Turnpike Lane and Cockfosters is listed.

                                  The Hammersmith and City line was opened on 13 June 1864 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR) as the Hammersmith
                  branch line. The railway became part of London Underground in 1933 and the took on a separate identity as the Hammersmith
                  and City line in 1988.
                                  
                                  In 1908 the Franco-British Exhibition and the 1908 Summer Olympics came to London, the first of a number of
                  major events in White City that attracted infrastructural investment by railway companies. Among others, the MR opened its
                  Wood Lane station on the Hammersmith branch to serve the event. From 1927 it was used to transport the public to and from
                  the greyhound racing at White City Stadium. The station opened and closed intermittently, and was renamed twice, to Wood Lane
                  (White City) in 1920 and White City in 1947, before it closed in 1959 following fire damage. For the next 49 years, the Wood
                  Lane area was served only by White City on the Central line; Hammersmith line trains passed over the lane without stopping,
                  the nearest station on that line approximately 1 km (0.62 mi) away at Shepherd's Bush.

               History: <span>
                                  The Northern line and Bakerloo line parts of the station were originally opened as two separate stations and
                  were combined when the now defunct Jubilee line platforms were opened. The constituent stations also underwent a number of
                  name changes during their history.
                                  
                                  The first part of the complex, the Bakerloo line platforms, was opened as Trafalgar Square by the Baker Street
                  &amp; Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR) on 10 March 1906. The Northern line platforms were opened a year later, as Charing Cross, by the
                  Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR, now the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line) on 22 June 1907. At
                  its opening this station was the southern terminus of the CCE&amp;HR which ran to two northern termini at Golders Green and Highgate
                  (now Archway) tube stations.
                                  
                                  Although both lines were owned and operated by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL),
                  there was no direct connection below ground and passengers interchanging between the lines had to do so via two sets of lifts
                  and the surface. In an effort to improve interchange capabilities, the CCE&amp;HR was extended the short distance south under
                  Charing Cross main line station to connect with the BS&amp;WR and the District Railway (another UERL line), opening as such on
                  6 April 1914.
