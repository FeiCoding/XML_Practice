            <history>
                The Northern line and Bakerloo line parts of the station were originally opened as two separate stations and were combined when the now defunct Jubilee line platforms were opened. The constituent stations also underwent a number of name changes during their history.
                
                The first part of the complex, the Bakerloo line platforms, was opened as Trafalgar Square by the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR) on 10 March 1906. The Northern line platforms were opened a year later, as Charing Cross, by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR, now the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line) on 22 June 1907. At its opening this station was the southern terminus of the CCE&amp;HR which ran to two northern termini at Golders Green and Highgate (now Archway) tube stations.
                
                Although both lines were owned and operated by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), there was no direct connection below ground and passengers interchanging between the lines had to do so via two sets of lifts and the surface. In an effort to improve interchange capabilities, the CCE&amp;HR was extended the short distance south under Charing Cross main line station to connect with the BS&amp;WR and the District Railway (another UERL line), opening as such on 6 April 1914.
